# Install and sign in to Live Share in Visual Studio Code

Ready to start collaborating with Live Share in Visual Studio Code? In this article, we'll walk you through setting up a collaboration session in Visual Studio Code by using the Live Share Extension.

Note that the collaboration activities described here involve a single collaboration session host and one or more guests. The host is the person who started the collaboration session, and anyone that joins is a guest.

*Looking for an abridged summary? Check out the [share](../quickstart/share.md) or [join](../quickstart/join.md) quickstarts.*

> [!TIP]
> Did you know that you can join your own collaboration session? Doing so allows you to try Live Share on your own or to spin up an instance of Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code and connect to it remotely. You can even use the same identity in both instances. Check it out!

## Prerequisites

Before you start, you'll need a supported version of Visual Studio Code for the Live Share core requirements. 

You'll need Visual Studio Code (1.22.0 or later) running on one of the following operating systems:

- **Windows**: 7, 8.1, or 10.

- **macOS**: Sierra (10.12) and later. Because of [.NET Core 2.0 requirements](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=872315), El Capitan (10.11) and earlier aren't currently supported.

- **Linux**: 64-bit Ubuntu Desktop 16.04 and later, Fedora Workstation 27 and later, or CentOS 7.
    - Live Share requires a number of [prerequisites for Linux](#linux-installation-steps). You might be prompted to install these items.
    - Because of [.NET Core 2.0 requirements](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=872314), 32-bit Linux isn't supported.
    - ARM is currently not supported.
    - See [Linux installation details](../reference/linux.md) for information on using downstream distributions and other distributions.

## Install the Live Share Extension Pack

When you download and use Visual Studio Live Share, you agree to the [license terms](https://aka.ms/vsls-license) and [privacy statement](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/privacystatement/EnterpriseDev/default.aspx). See [troubleshooting](../troubleshooting.md) if you run into problems.

1. Install <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a>.
2. [Download](https://aka.ms/vsls-dl/vscode) and install the Visual Studio Live Share Extension Pack from Marketplace.
3. Reload Visual Studio Code.
4. Wait for dependencies to download and install. (See the status bar.)<br/>
    ![Screenshot that shows the status bar during download.](../media/vscode-finishing-install.png)
5. *Linux only*: If you see a notification about installing missing libraries:
    1. Select **Install** in the notification.
    2. Enter your admin (sudo) password when prompted.
    3. Restart Visual Studio Code when the installation is done.

### Linux installation steps

Linux is a highly variable environment. Given the number of desktop environments and distributions, getting Live Share installed can be complicated. If you use supported versions of Ubuntu Desktop (16.04+), Fedora Workstation (27+), or CentOS 7 and only use official distributions of Visual Studio Code, the process should be straightforward. If you're using a nonstandard configuration or downstream distribution, you might encounter complications. For more information, see [Linux installation details](../reference/linux.md).

#### Install Linux prerequisites

Some distributions of Linux are missing libraries that Live Share needs. By default, Live Share attempts to detect and install Linux prerequisites. You'll see a notification prompting you to install libraries when Live Share encounters a problem that can be caused by missing libraries:

![Screenshot of notification for missing Linux libraries.](../media/vscode-linux-prereq-missing.png)

When you select **Install**, a terminal window will open. Enter your admin (sudo) password to continue. If the installation completes successfully, restart Visual Studio Code. You should be all set. You might also want to check out [Tips by distribution](../reference/linux.md#tips-by-distribution) for other hints and workarounds.

If you see a message stating that the script doesn't support your distribution, see [Tips for community-supported distributions](../reference/linux.md#tips-for-community-supported-distros) for information the community has shared with us.

If you don't want Visual Studio Code to run the command for you, you can also re-run the latest version of this script at any time by running this command from a terminal window:

```
wget -O ~/vsls-reqs https://aka.ms/vsls-linux-prereq-script && chmod +x ~/vsls-reqs && ~/vsls-reqs
```

#### Linux browser integration

Visual Studio Live Share doesn't typically require additional installation steps to enable browser integration on Linux.

On certain rare distributions, you might be notified that your admin (sudo) password is required to complete the installation. A terminal window noting where the browser launcher will be installed will appear. Enter your password when prompted, and select **Enter** when the installation completes to close the terminal window.

For information about why the password is required and where Live Share puts files, see [Linux browser integration](../reference/linux.md#linux-browser-integration). If you can't get browser integration to work, you can still [join collaboration sessions manually](share-project-join-session-visual-studio-code.md#join-manually).

## Sign in to Live Share

To collaborate, you'll need to sign in to Visual Studio Live Share so everyone knows who you are. This is a security measure and doesn't add you to marketing activities or other research activities. You can sign in by using a Microsoft personal account (for example, @outlook.com), a Microsoft-backed work or school account (Azure Active Directory), or a GitHub account. Signing in is easy.

Select **Live Share** on the status bar or select **Ctrl+Shift+P** or **Cmd+Shift+P** and then select **Live Share: Sign In With Browser**.

![Screenshot that shows the Visual Studio Code sign in button.](../media/vscode-sign-in-button.png)

A notification will prompt you to sign in by using your web browser. When you select **launch sign in**, a browser will open so you can complete the sign-in process. Simply close the browser when you're done.

> [!note]
> Linux users: You might be prompted to enter a user code if you're using an older version of Live Share (0.3.295 or earlier). Update to the latest version of the extension or, to see the code, select **Having trouble?** after you sign in. For details, see [Sign in by using a user code](#sign-in-by-using-a-user-code).


> **Advanced tip:** The `liveshare.account` and `liveshare.accountProvider` settings enable you to select the account used for automatic sign-in if you have cached credentials for multiple accounts.
> For example, imagine you work on two projects and you want to sign in to them by using different identities. In your Visual Studio Code workspace settings, you could set `liveshare.account` to a different email address in each project directory. The projects will then automatically sign in with the correct account. You can set the `liveshare.accountProvider` setting to either `"microsoft"` or `"github"` if you use the same email address with multiple providers.

If Visual Studio Code isn't picking up your sign-in after you complete the sign-in process in the browser, see [sign in by using a user code](#sign-in-by-using-a-user-code). Or check out [troubleshooting](../troubleshooting.md#sign-in) for more tips.

### Sign in by using a user code

If Visual Studio Code isn't picking up a completed sign-in, you can enter a *user code* instead.

1. Select **Ctrl+Shift+P** or **Cmd+Shift+P** and then run the **Live Share: Sign in with user code** command.

2. A browser should open. Use it to complete the sign-in process:

    > [!NOTE]
    > If a browser doesn't open automatically, go to https://insiders.liveshare.vsengsaas.visualstudio.com/auth/login and sign in.

3. After you're done, select **Having trouble? Click here for user code directions** to see the user code.

    ![Screenshot that shows a user code in a browser window.](../media/vscode-user-code-browser.png)

4. Copy the user code.

5. Paste the user code into the input field that appeared when you ran the command. Select **Enter** to complete the sign-in process.
